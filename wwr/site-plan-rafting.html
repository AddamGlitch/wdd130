    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>We have been in the rafting business for a decent amount of time now but have always lacked an online presence. This as a result means we lose out by not making use of the online space. Using a new business model, we will now be concentrating on building up our online presence using our site that customers will be using for signing up for services in the most convenient way possible. The website will also serve as a point where clients and potential clients will get all the information they need with regards to the rafting services we offer.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The targeted audience will be potential customers in the online space that do not know about the business and the services it offers. Customers who want to see what services we offer and the competitive cost of our business. We did a little survey that shows us that about eighty percent of our customers will want to see our products and services online and would also like to be able to pay for them online too. So this site will alleviate the needs of those customers while also helping to sell the business to potential customers out there. We will be using CSS to make our website adjustable for all platforms and screen sizes. </p>
