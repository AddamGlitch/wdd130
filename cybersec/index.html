                Cybersecurity awareness involves being mindful of cybersecurity in day-to-day 
                situations. Being aware of the dangers of browsing the web, checking email and 
                interacting online are all components of cybersecurity awareness. As business 
                leaders, it’s our responsibility to make sure everyone considers cybersecurity 
                an essential part of their role. Not everyone in an organization needs to understand 
                concepts like SPF records and DNS cache poisoning, but empowering every employee 
                with information relevant to their role helps them stay safe online—both at work 
                and home. Role-based training for technical and non-technical staff is the best 
                way to prepare the right people for the right cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity 
                awareness could mean something a bit different to your general workforce than it 
                means to technical teams. Management of data, permissions and regulations are topics 
                that your IT team needs to know but aren’t necessarily relevant to the rest of your 
                organization. Delivering the appropriate training to each team is vital to building a 
                cybersecurity awareness program that motivates lasting behavior change. </p>
